Mexico is my second home. Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta are my main destinations for Mexico . I spend one month there in Nov and 1 month in March. Most of my time is spent mainly in Mazatlan, where I own a condo,  to play tennis and then about  5 days in Puerto Vallarta to Salsa dance. It is the dolce Vita ( sweet life) ,sunny and day time temps of about +28.

I  enjoy hosting on Airbnb mainly because I like meeting new people and having people come from around the world. I use Airbnb whenever I can for traveling around the world because it is so affordable.   Dom and his wife Jessica live close by my home and are co hosts with my airbnb.

I am an independent professional woman, a humanitarian at heart.

I was raised on a family farm in a rural community in Manitoba.  I am a specialty nurse and work in two WRHA hospitals in Winnipeg as an operating room nurse. I am a retired Canadian Forces nursing officer and am presently working with the International Operations of the Canadian Red Cross (Emergency Response Unit) in affiliation with the International Committee and International Federation of the Red Cross out of Geneva. Whenever the need arises, I am called to engage in medical humanitarian operations around the world with teams from many nations.

I am passionate about humanitarian work and have been on several missions/deployments around the world: Afghanistan, Honduras, Dominican Republic, South Sudan, South East Asia, Nepal, Iraq, Bangladesh etc.

I enjoy engaging in sports activities and dancing. I enjoy participating in fund raising events for several organizations along with my family and friends. 

I have been blessed with two wonderful children who are independent and very close to me.

We love to volunteer for special events around the city and local communities especially in the summer time. 

I enjoy hosting on Airbnb mainly because I like meeting new people, exchanging stories and experiences and having people visit from around the world. I use Airbnb, whenever available, for my visits to other nations because it is so affordable and they have very interesting and extremely helpful hosts.
 
I love to travel especially on adventure trips where I can hike, engage in white water rafting, zip lining etc. I also enjoy luxuries but prefer to mingle with locals to learn their culture through conversation and by listening to their stories. 

I enjoy cooking and making homemade foods, especially Ethnic & Mediterranean dishes. I also enjoy gardening and taking care of my yard to compliment the neighborhood.

Winnipeg is a highly spirited city. Just ask me!

Thank you.

Kindest Regards,
Dianne

We pretty much do everything together, most importantly, we raised a beautiful daughter and along the way  ran a business together - from which we recently retired.   Now, on to our next venture... we've decided to try our hand at hosting an Airbnb. We believe the difference between good and great is all in the details and we can't wait to exceed your expectations.

I enjoyed the many guests from all over the world.  People coming to fish, film makers, families and many dogs.  I have since sold these homes and have one airbnb location in Winnipeg.  The Riverview area in Winnipeg is so nice for walking, close to groceries library and coffee.  Great proximity to downtown Winnipeg and the Forks Market.  My home is pet friendly and has hosted many well behaved dogs. The Arnold house is old, built in the early 1900’s, fully insulated with some good triple pane new windows for nice air flow.  
The house is small with one small bedroom.  The living room has room for sleeping.  The house has good wifi and Bell Satelite TV.  The kitchen has a bit of everything.
The home has forced air natural gas heat and central air conditioning.  

The Riverview area was home for me since 1999.  I purchased and lived in 3 different Riverview homes over 20 years.  I owned many rental properties in the area that kept me busy.  I also purchased the old historic Park Theatre with my son’s  (Luke 17) father in 2004.  We turned the beautiful old Park Theatre into an event venue with good coffee and a place for neighbours to gather.  We rented DVD’s in our cafe and enjoyed watching our son grow up as we hosted gatherings from Weddings to music performances.  


I have recently moved and now live 15 minutes away on 2.5 acres with my teenage son and a lot of animals. We grow food and enjoy the great outdoors.  Thank you for finding our little house in Riverview.

There is hardwood flooring throughout, white walls with artwork (I'm an artist), and big windows.  The downstairs is mostly open-concept and though the house is not a big one, it has a spacious feel to it: the front sun room leads into the hallway/stairway, which leads into the combined living room and dining room.  The kitchen and a mudroom for coats/shoes are at the back of the main floor. <br /><br />Upstairs is the master bedroom, bathroom with full bath/shower, and a second bedroom/den, which has a comfortable futon with a foam top in it.  Our home accommodates up to 4 adults/children.<br /><br />Outside there's on-site parking for 1 vehicle, additional free parking on the street, a grassy front yard, a small front garden (a raised planter bed - help yourself to herbs and veggies!),  ","The Corydon neighbourhood is a fantastic one!  You can easily and quickly walk to all the stores that you need (grocery, hardware, flower store etc), and also to a very special (arguably the best in town!) bakery, as well as a fantastic cheese shop, and my favourite restaurant in Winnipeg (as well as many other restaurants, bars etc).  There's a school around the corner from our house, and with that comes a nice neighbourly feel to the area - which is quiet and residential, but only 3 blocks away from a main restaurant/shopping area.

As a little girl, I always admired the way a space and its?contents have the ability to create memories and feelings. One of my earliest realizations of that experience was when my family and I spend a Christmas at a refugee camp when I was 10 years old. We had just escaped communism, leaving everything behind, yet my parents managed to create for us a lovely corner in our room with a small decorated Christmas tree, a bowl of nuts, some Mandarins, and even a few small presents. I still remember wondering how they managed to put this together for my sister and me? It was the loveliest feeling and that wonderful memory is still vivid in my mind as one of my very favorite Christmases. 

Perhaps it is this experience in leaving our life and all our worldly possessions behind to start again, which makes me always pause in a space and take in how it makes me feel. I truly believe in the wonder and emotional connection to the things that we choose to surround ourselves with. 

I have also been fortunate to put my head down on a pillow in many lovely places during my 20 years of executive global travel. I have come to appreciate that there are a few essentials that have always put a smile on my face and made me feel at home while traveling away from home. It is with this mindset that my family and I have approached the creation of this loft, our special space. 

A beautifully-appointed loft, with comfy bedding and linens, lovely amenities, all the comforts of home, and an opportunity to connect with locals, are but a few of the things that we hope our home and family can offer. We are passionate about our city and would love to share everything that may be of interest to you about Winnipeg. There is so much to discover and talk about in English, French, or Czech if you prefer.
We look forward to meeting you.

As a child, I watched my mother host hundreds of visitors from all around the world. I would wonder why she would invite all these people at home for dinner, lunch or breakfast. Sometimes some would stay for a week, a month or just a few days.  My mother would go the extra mile to make sure all the guests felt at home. She was and still is the most wonderful host I ever known.

Now that I have grown, I understand that this is a natural gift that she had and took pride in. She found, still finds great satisfaction in it.

I started to join my mother in this beautiful adventure, and I started to fall in love with hosting guests with her. And now, it’s always a joy to host friends at my own house.

My siblings say that I love to serve people. And that can’t be far from the truth. 

I started thinking of being an Airbnb host since 2017. I even opened an account but as they say, God’s time is always the best. Last year , we decided to go all in with my husband.

For the few months, this has been the best adventure we both are on. So great to host incredible people who are visiting our beautiful city of Winnipeg. 

And as someone who travels and uses Airbnb in other cities, I knew exactly what guests love. We’ve made sure that when you stay at any of our properties, it’s a home away from home experience. 

We’ve gone above & beyond to make sure that when you book your stay with us, you’ll have the most memorable time. And you’ll have everything you need.

Like many downtown neighbourhoods in Canada, we have our share of traffic noise, homeless, and the need for street-smarts and common sense when on foot.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-591218248888172290/original/0273e5fc-8da4-4845-ae87-0c0f4cdb4ffe.jpeg,76016934,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/76016934,Michael,2016/6/5,"Winnipeg, Canada",,within an hour,100%,99%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/6356b71d-82ae-4f16-8c25-597b55fa28cf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/6356b71d-82ae-4f16-8c25-597b55fa28cf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Spence,2,9,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada",Daniel McIntyre,,49.895622,-97.157478,Private room in home,Private room,2,,2 shared baths,1,1,"[""BBQ grill"", ""Oven"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Shower gel"", ""Essentials"", ""Baking sheet"", ""HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Roku"", ""Hot water"", ""Heating"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Bread maker"", ""Paid parking lot on premises \u2013 1 space"", ""Fire pit"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Microwave"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Bed linens"", ""Freezer"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Breakfast"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Conditioner"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Dining table"", ""Hangers"", ""Free street parking"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Clothing storage: closet"", ""Shampoo"", ""First aid kit"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Game console"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Shared garden or backyard"", ""Stove"", ""Keypad"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Toaster"", ""Kitchen"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Iron"", ""Mini fridge"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Board games"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Portable fans""]",46.00 ,1,211,1,45,1125,1125,4.4,1125,,t,13,43,73,253,2022/9/13,27,27,2,2022/3/31,2022/8/22,4.96,5,5,5,4.93,4.85,4.96,,t,2,0,2,0,4.85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a child, I watched my mother host hundreds of visitors from all around the world. I would wonder why she would invite all these people at home for dinner, lunch or breakfast. Sometimes some would stay for a week, a month or just a few days.  My mother would go the extra mile to make sure all the guests felt at home. She was and still is the most wonderful host I ever known.

Now that I have grown, I understand that this is a natural gift that she had and took pride in. She found, still finds great satisfaction in it.

I started to join my mother in this beautiful adventure, and I started to fall in love with hosting guests with her. And now, it’s always a joy to host friends at my own house.

My siblings say that I love to serve people. And that can’t be far from the truth. 

I started thinking of being an Airbnb host since 2017. I even opened an account but as they say, God’s time is always the best. Last year , we decided to go all in with my husband.

For the few months, this has been the best adventure we both are on. So great to host incredible people who are visiting our beautiful city of Winnipeg. 

And as someone who travels and uses Airbnb in other cities, I knew exactly what guests love. We’ve made sure that when you stay at any of our properties, it’s a home away from home experience. 

We’ve gone above & beyond to make sure that when you book your stay with us, you’ll have the most memorable time. And you’ll have everything you need. 

So if you have friends or family visiting Winnipeg and they would love a place to stay, we would be happy to host them. 

We currently have 3 Short Term Rentals. And we are Now SUPERHOST .  View them and watch the virtual tour for the 2 of them.

I’m really excited to host you & your families.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5d67fe87-1279-4c81-ae79-703ba583f5b1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5d67fe87-1279-4c81-ae79-703ba583f5b1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,St. George,7,11,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Elmwood - East Kildonan,,49.90959,-97.10282,Entire home,Entire home/apt,13,,2 baths,5,6,"[""Dishes and silverware"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In building"", ""Essentials"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Crib"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib - available upon request"", ""Dove  body soap"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 92 Mbps"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Microwave"", ""Bed linens"", ""Stainless steel oven"", ""Freezer"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Free washer \u2013 In building"", ""Conditioner"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Dining table"", ""Hangers"", ""Free street parking"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Rice maker"", ""Private entrance"", ""Stainless steel stove"", ""Shampoo"", ""First aid kit"", ""Safe"", ""Private fenced garden or backyard"", ""High chair"", ""Smart lock"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Toaster"", ""Kitchen"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Iron"", ""TV"", ""Central heating"", ""Cleaning before checkout"", ""Trash compactor"", ""Portable fans""]",397.00 ,2,365,2,2,1125,1125,2,1125,,t,18,44,74,235,2022/9/13,1,1,1,2022/8/15,2022/8/15,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,,t,3,3,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a child, I watched my mother host hundreds of visitors from all around the world. I would wonder why she would invite all these people at home for dinner, lunch or breakfast. Sometimes some would stay for a week, a month or just a few days.  My mother would go the extra mile to make sure all the guests felt at home. She was and still is the most wonderful host I ever known.

Now that I have grown, I understand that this is a natural gift that she had and took pride in. She found, still finds great satisfaction in it.

I started to join my mother in this beautiful adventure, and I started to fall in love with hosting guests with her. And now, it’s always a joy to host friends at my own house.

My siblings say that I love to serve people. And that can’t be far from the truth. 

I started thinking of being an Airbnb host since 2017. I even opened an account but as they say, God’s time is always the best. Last year , we decided to go all in with my husband.

For the few months, this has been the best adventure we both are on. So great to host incredible people who are visiting our beautiful city of Winnipeg. 

And as someone who travels and uses Airbnb in other cities, I knew exactly what guests love. We’ve made sure that when you stay at any of our properties, it’s a home away from home experience. 

We’ve gone above & beyond to make sure that when you book your stay with us, you’ll have the most memorable time. And you’ll have everything you need.
